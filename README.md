## IronTreads

IronTreads is a Unity 3D tank game project that is currently under active development.
The project is mainly focused on learning and experimenting with core game mechanics such as movement, shooting, enemy behavior, and basic AI.

Rather than aiming for a finished commercial product, this project is built as a clean and simple learning playground.
Special attention is given to keeping the codebase readable, modular, and easy to improve over time.

AI tools are used during development as a support for learning, problem-solving, and exploring different design approaches.
